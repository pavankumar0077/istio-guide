## SERVICE MESH

### WHAT IS SERVICE MESH IN KUBERNETES CLUSTER
- SERVICE MESH MANAGES THE TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT IN KUBERNETES CLUSTER SPECIALLY EAST WEST TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT OF K8S CLUSTER.
- TRAFFIC BETWEEN KUBERENTES SERVICES AND CLUSTERS
- 

### EX :
- A E-com application is deployed in kubernetes cluster with 4 microservices (login, catalog, payment, notification)
- LOGIN --> CATALOG --> PAYMENTS --> NOTIFICATIONS
- If this e-com application has to expose to the customers or to the users outside the kubernetes cluster -- A IGRESS IS CREATED OR SERVICE TYPE OF NODEPORT OR LOAD BALANCER TYPE
- user must access the LOGIN microservice outside the KUBERNETES CLUSTER. Only then the e-com application will be able to LOGIN from the user or customers.
- IN THIS WE NEED TO CONTROL THE TRAFFIC -- ONE is traffic comming from the ingress -- that is from the users -- outside the kubernetes cluster ==== THIS IS CALLED NORTH SOUTH GRAPH
- OTHER one is LOGIN TALKING TO THE CATALOG -- AND FLOW GOES --> PAYMENTS --> NOTIFICATIONS, THIS DOESN'T REQUIRED ANY INGRESS OR EGRESS TRAFFIC ==== THIS IS CALLED AS EAST WEST TRAFFIC


### WHY SERVICE MESH
- AS SEEN ABOVE EXAMPLE SERVICE TO SERVICE COMMUNICATION IS POSSIBLE
- BUT ISTIO ENHANCES OR ADDS ON CAPABILITES TO YOUR SERVICE TO SERVICE COMMUNICATION SUCH AS **MUTUAL TLS**

### WHAT IS MUTUAL TLS
- IF WE INSTALL ISTIO AND ALLOW ISTIO TO A PARTICULAR NAME SPACE THEN ISTIO SAYS IT WILL SECURE SERVICE TO SERVICE COMMUNICATION
- BYDEFAULT THESE SERVICES ARE TALING WITHOUT ANY TLS WITHOUT ANY SECURIY MEASURES
- IF WE NEED INSTALL IT WILL ADD MUTUAL TLS, SO ALL THE 4 MICROSERVICES WILL HAVE TLS CERTIFICATE WHICH WLL BE GIVEN BY CERTICATE AUTHORITY (CA) OF ISTIO
- WHEN LOGIN SERVICE WANTS TO COMMUNICATE WITH CATALOG IT WILL DISPLAY THE CERTIFICATE BOTH DISPLAYS THEIR CERTIFICATES
