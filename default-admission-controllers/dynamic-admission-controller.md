- Dynamic admission control - Happens in multiple stages the same pod creation request comes to the kubernetes cluster API-SERVER WILL PERFORM AUTH & AUTHORIZATION
- BUT HERE NOT THE STANDARDED ADMISSION CONTROLLERS, THERE ARE 2 SPECIAL ADMISSION CONTROLLERS WHICH ARE CALLED AS
- 1. MUTATING ADMISSION WEB HOOK CONTROLLER
  2. VALIDATING ADMISSION WEB HOOK CONTROLLER ALONG WITH THE TRADTIONAL CONTROLLERS
- THE RESPONSIBLITY OF THE COTROLLERS ARE THE ONCES THEY WILL TAKE OUR INPUT OR THEY TAKE REQEUST FROM THE API-SERVER AND THEY NOTIFY ISTIO OR ANY OTHER PROJECT THAT WANTS TO IMPLEMENT THE SIDECAR INJECTION OR ANY KIND OF MUTATION AND VALIDATION
- SO which COMPONENT OF API SERVER IS TAKING THIS RESPONSIBILITY IT IS AGAIN AN ADMISSION CONTROLLER WHICH IS HELPING IN THE DYNAMIC ADMISSION CONTROL BUT THIS COMPONENT DOES NOT PERFORM THE MUTATION OR VALIDATION IT ONLY FORWARDS THE REQEUST TO ANY WEB HOOK THAT IS IMPLEMENTED BY THE PROJECT
- So ISTIO IS GOING TO IMPLEMENT AN ADMISSION WEB HOOK WHICH IS AGAIN A KUBERNETS CONTROLLER IT IS PART OF ISTIOD AND THIS ADMISSION WEB HOOK IS CALLED BY THE MUTATING ADMISSION WEB HOOK CONTROLLER THIS GOING TO PERFORM MUTATION LOGIC AND IT IS GOING TO INJECT THE SIDE-CAR CONTAINER AND THEN OBJECT IS PERSISTED INTO ETCD.
